# Frontend-Project
This is a responsive single-page website for Pritam Restaurant, created as part of an internship interview project. Using HTML5 and CSS3, I designed a modern and user-friendly interface that showcases the restaurant's key features and services. The website's responsive design ensures a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
